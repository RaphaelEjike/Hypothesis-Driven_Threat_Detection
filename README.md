# Hypothesis-Driven_Threat_Detection
This GitHub project provides Threat Intelligence Analysts with a comprehensive framework to create, validate, and test hypotheses for identifying suspicious activities, vulnerabilities, and malicious actions within network environments. The repository emphasises real-world methodologies while maintaining a sector-agnostic approach, ensuring applicability across industries. By combining technical tools and best practices, the project aims to enable effective threat detection and actionable insights.

## Prioritised Threats

### Ransomware
Examples: Hypotheses targeting file encryption activities, malicious PowerShell execution, or network-wide lateral movement.
### Insider Threats
Examples: Hypotheses on abnormal login patterns or unauthorised data access.
### Zero-Day Attacks
Examples: Hypotheses centred around exploitation of unpatched software vulnerabilities.


### Kill Chain Focus
This documentation will be organised by the following stages, offering insights into potential attack vectors and hypotheses:

- Initial Access: Malicious email links, credential stuffing.
- Persistence: Registry modifications, scheduled tasks.
- Privilege Escalation: Exploiting vulnerabilities or weak configurations.
- Defence Evasion: Disabling antivirus, obfuscated scripts.
- Credential Access: Credential dumping, pass-the-hash attacks.
- Discovery: Network scanning, host enumeration.
- Lateral Movement: SMB exploits, compromised user accounts.
- Command and Control (C2): Suspicious beaconing patterns.
- Exfiltration: Unusual data transfer volumes.
